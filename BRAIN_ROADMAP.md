## Next Brain to Build

**Recommended next:** Product Brain

Why:
1. Defines WHAT to build (before Engineering builds it)
2. Creates PRDs, specs, roadmaps
3. Bridges business goals and technical execution
4. High leverage - improves all other work

---

## How to Build a New Brain

1. Create folder: `/prototype_x1000/brain_name/`
2. Create `CLAUDE.md` (use Engineering/Design as template)
3. Add "Calls other brains" section with `/prototype_x1000/` paths
4. Add COMMIT RULE section (mandatory for all brains)
5. Create core pattern files
6. Create Memory/ folder
7. Add to CEO Brain's list
8. Update `.claude/SYSTEM-PROMPT.md`
9. Commit
